Project Description: 

This is a implementation of a Boggle solver game. 
The goal of the program is it to find every word from a given dictionary in a grid of characters.
The requirements are that words must be adjacent tiles, including diagonals, 
Each word may not use a tile more than once,
Words need to be longer than 2 characters
and a "qu" and "st" counts as 2 letters, there are no raw "s" or "q" tiles.
There are also no other tiles allowed with a bigger length than 1 other that "st" and "qu".
