Project Description: 

This is a implementation of a Boggle solver game. 
The goal of the program is it to find every word from a given dictionary in a grid of characters.
The requirements are that words must be adjacent tiles, including diagonals, 
Each word may not use a tile more than once,
Words need to be longer than 2 characters
and a "qu" and "st" counts as 2 letters, there are no raw "s" or "q" tiles.
There are also no other tiles allowed with a bigger length than 1 other that "st" and "qu".

Group Members:

- Benjamin Hoesli
- Peter Gansallo
- Esau Hutcherson

Defects Found:

No defects were found in the code by the reviewers.

Summary of Recommendation:

- Peter Gansallo: 
Move helper functions to the top of the file.
Add a comment to the helper function to explain what it does.
Change the variable name of "N".

- Esau Hutcherson
Create a helper function named toLowerCheck.
Create helper function for cresting the hash map.
Create helper function to build the different words.
Change variable name of "N".
Overall, break the findAllSolutions into smaller pieces.

Review Time and Defects Found:

I think my reviewers did a great job in reviewing my code.
I can tell that they both invested time to look at my code in detail.
While my reviewers did not find any defects in my code, 
they did make very helpful recommendations to improve my code.
The biggest improvement i implemented was to include more helper functions 
in order to keep my main function clean and simple.
This allows anydody to quickly understand what exactly my code is doing at different stages.
Another helpful tip was to add comments to all the helper functions.
This gives a quick overview of what every function's main job is.

While I agreed to most improvement recommendations from my reviewers, 
there were a few poiunts I disagreed on implementing.
Ther first point I disagreed on was to change the variable name of "N".
While a name like "length" might be more understandable at first glance, 
The explanation of the code asks for a "NxN" grid. 
Therefore I wanted to make sure that I use the same terminology as in the explanation.
Another thing i did not choose to implement was to move my helper functions to the top of the main file.
The reason i did not chose to do that was because I thionk the "star of the show" should be the main function.
If anyone would like to take a closer look at the code, they can still scroll down to see the helper functions.

Esau provided me with 5 recommendations for my code from which I used 3 to improve my code.
Peter provided me with 3 recommendations from which I used 1 to improve my code.

Both feedbacks were very helpful and I'm very happy with my final implementation of the boggle solver.
